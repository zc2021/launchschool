pt 1) Breakfast - method meal returns 'Breakfast', puts prints value of argument
pt 2) Evening - same reason as above, different return value in method
pt 3) Breakfast - explicit return on line 1 of method call exits method before line 2, becomes identical to pt 1
pt 4) Dinner
	Breakfast
	- Dinner prints from inside meal method given as argument to puts, puts prints meal return value of Breakfast
pt 5) 'Dinner'
	'Dinner'
	nil
	- p prints each line as executed?
	WRONG -> puts executes (prints from inside meal method call), then 'p' prints nil returned by meal method
	First 'Dinner' in meal method IS NOT PRINTED
pt 6) Breakfast - functionally same as pt 3
