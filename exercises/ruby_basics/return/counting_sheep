pt 1) wrong on all counts - prints nums 0 - 5 on a separate line
	#times method called on integer repeats passed block int times
	passes value from 0 to int-1
	returns initial integer
	#times called in count_sheep returns 5 to count_sheep, which is then printed with puts
pt 2)   0
	1
	2
	3
	4
	10
	- 0 - 4 print due to #times call on int 5 in count_sheep method definition, as in pt 1. 10 prints as it is returned from count_sheep and passed to the puts call on line 8
pt 3)   0
	1
	5 X nil -> because return statement does not return value; Integer#times never returns Integer
	- same as starts of pts 1 & 2, but count_sheep returns during 2nd iteration of #times block due to return in if statement [SEE CORRECTION RE: RETURN VALUE]
